 About the branches:
    - main: have the App
    - login_feature: the form and auth context
    - routes feature: I'll try to develop only the routes
 
 0. Install

    1. In the index.js file:
        - import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
        - Wrap the App with the BrowserRouter component ( I prefer in the index file, but it could be also in the App or wherever I should wrap to wrap the routes)
    
    2. In the App file (or wherever I wanna use the Route)
        - <code> import { Route, Routes } from "react-router-dom"; </code>;
        -  Wrap the component with the route and path, e.g.:
            <Routes>
                <Route path='/' element={<HomePage/>} />
            </Routes>
